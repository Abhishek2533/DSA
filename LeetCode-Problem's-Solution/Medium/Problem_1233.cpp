1233. Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem


Given a list of folders folder, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.
If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it. A sub-folder of folder[j] must start with folder[j], followed by a "/". For example, "/a/b" is a sub-folder of "/a", but "/b" is not a sub-folder of "/a/b/c".
The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.
For example, "/leetcode" and "/leetcode/problems" are valid paths while an empty string and "/" are not.


Example 1:
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.

Example 2:
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".

Example 3:
Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]


Constraints:
1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 104
2 <= folder[i].length <= 100
folder[i] contains only lowercase letters and '/'.
folder[i] always starts with the character '/'.
Each folder name is unique.
